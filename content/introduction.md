I'm MD Gaziur Rahman Noor. I'm a student and a hobbyist programmer. I'm from Bangladesh.
I've started coding in 2017. However, I wasn't so serious about it. During the COVID lockdown, I started to use the free time to do programming. I started with learning Python. I made some personal projects such as a micro blog, an url shortener and COVID-19 statistics tracker.

A few months later, I moved to Javascript. I was trying to make an online judge back then. After going to issues that are caused by the weirdness of Javascript, I decided to try Typescript. I learned stuff like MongoDB, GraphQL and Docker.

Fast forward to 2021, I started learning Rust. I immediately fell in love with that langauge. The type system and the way compiler prevented undefined behaviours was absolutely fascinating to me. I became more and more interested to low level stuff like compilers and operating systems.

I authored [Findex](https://github.com/mdgaziur/findex) and [YAL](https://github.com/mdgaziur/yal). I have planned more projects to work on in near future.

That's it, a short description of myself :3
